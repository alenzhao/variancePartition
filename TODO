Improve warnings in fitVarPart and fitExtractVarPart to show which gene give a warning

# April 16, 2016
 Make correlation matrix and linear mixed model equantions in vignette
 the same as in supplement.  The vignette examples are wrong

Add canCorPairs to the vignette

add e_{i,k} in ICC correlation equation

# Add strong warning to fitVarPartModel() that estimates memory usage.  In vignette, users should be discoraged from using this interface.

# use refit() to fit the model for each gene:
#  cannot do this because refit() doesn't accept new weights

# DE test: show increased power when correlation is overestimated, and decrease false positive rate when correlation is underestimated.  (order is correct?)  





# adjust doesn't work with varying coefficient model, but it throwings an error now

# run simulations with varying coefficient model
